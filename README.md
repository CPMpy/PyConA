## PyConA: Constraint Acquisition in Python

PyConA ([https://github.com/CPMpy/PyConA](https://github.com/CPMpy/PyConA)) is a python-based, open-source package for Constraint Acquisition (CA). In CA, **the goal is to assist the user in modeling**  Constraint Programming (CP) problems, by learning the constraints through user interaction.

PyConA is based on the powerful CPMpy Constraint Programming and Modeling library in python (https://github.com/CPMpy/cpmpy), which is used for modeling the constraint problems.

Currently, only interactive CA methods are implemented in PyConA; passive CA methods might be added later.

### Interactive Constraint Acquisition

![Interactive Constraint Acquisition](images/ca-framework.png)

In interactive CA, the system interacts with an Oracle, which can be a human user or a software system. The CA system asks queries and based on the answers of the oracle it either learns or excludes constraints.

PyConA is a generic CA library implementing a range of interactive CA methods, using the following modules:
- Interactive CA Algorithm: The top-level algorithm to be used.
- Query Generation: The query generation system to be used to generate top-level queries.
- FindScope: The FindScope system to be used for finding the scope of violated constraints.
- FindConstraint: The FindConstraint system to be used for finding the exact violated constraints in the given scopes.

### Basics

In **PyConA**, the ProblemInstance class represents the instance of the problem the user wants to acquire the constraints for. It must be initialized with the variables of the problem and a language. 
A CA system is then used to acquire the constraints. A CA system uses a CA environment to configure its options. 
**PyConA** currently implements only interactive CA algorithms (module .active_algorithms).The core of interactive CA systems is the AlgorithmCAInteractive class. This is subclassed with different algorithms presented in the literature.

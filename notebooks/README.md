In this folder, we have introductory notebooks that 
can help getting a first look to different aspects of PyConA.

</a>: In this notebook, you can find an introduction to the basics of PyConA; how to create a problem instance for interactive CA and run an algorithm of choice.

**Comparing different algorithms and methods** <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/CPMpy/PyConA/blob/main/notebooks/Comparing%20different%20algorithms%20and%20methods.ipynb">
